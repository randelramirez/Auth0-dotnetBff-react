This repository contains a React SPA supported by an ASP.NET Core backend to implement authentication and authorization with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) through the Backend For Frontend (BFF) pattern.

The following article describes the implementation details: [Backend For Frontend Authentication Pattern with Auth0 and ASP.NET Core](https://auth0.com/blog/backend-for-frontend-pattern-with-auth0-and-dotnet/)

## ðŸ“‹  TO DO:
1.) Update to .NET 6 âœ… <br>
2.) Fix dependency issues on ClientApp âœ… <br>
3.) Include startup of ClientApp development server on BFF start up (run/debug) âœ… <br>
4.) Implement Refresh Token âœ… <br> 
5.) Migrate ClientApp from CRA to Vite (React/TypeScript) âœ… <br>
6.) Create separate branch /or change controllers to minimal api (endpoints) <br>
7.) Create a version where the client app and ASP.NET Core(UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer) are using the same port âœ…<br>
7.) Create a version where the client app is hosted on Razor page<br>

This approach meant that the launch code needed to be specific for each front-end framework, resulting in hard-to-maintain code for each front-end framework that the Microsoft team wanted to support. <br>

From .NET 6, the new templates for Angular and React switch how the front end and back end communicate. They use the front endâ€™s proxy solutions to send the request to the back end. The popular front-end frameworks already have built-in support for development server proxying, but they must also be configured each specific to the used framework. The ASP.NET app still launches the front-end development server, but the request comes from that server.

Advantages of this new approach include:

    Simpler configuration in the back-end files
    The back end is more independent from the front-end framework but not completely separate as the launch command and URL are still specific
    No more framework-specific code in the back endâ€™s Startup.cs or Program.cs files
    Extensible to other front-end frameworks not included in the templates


ViteProxy = uses front end proxy <br>
UseProxyToSpaDevelopment = front end is serve in the same port as ASP.NET Core <br>
